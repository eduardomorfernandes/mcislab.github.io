<li>Reference 1 - 0.59% Coverage =&gt; We strongly suggest that common sense options are the default. We use the &amp;quot;convention over configuration&amp;quot; pattern. We never force a developer to add an configuration option that is the same for most applications

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Reference 1 - 0.25% Coverage =&gt; One bug produced a new option instead of fixing the existing options which lead to the bug&#x2026;
</li>

<li>Reference 2 - 0.79% Coverage =&gt; Nesting options was not originally planned for, but was quickly encountered. This led to a few additional iterations that could have been avoided. Using standard format (JSON, YAML, S-Expressions) would have saved some up-front costs but the original system sort of grew organically.
</li>

<li>Reference 3 - 0.68% Coverage =&gt; We should have anticipated nested configurations, but the config system sort of grew organically at first. Later we had to step back and redesign it. Using something standard earlier (JSON, YAML, S-Expressions) would have saved some later pain.

<li>Reference 2 - 0.52% Coverage =&gt; I think the biggest problems are created by developers. They are doing configuration files/variables that only they know and use fluently. They don’t presume that others might need them.
</li>

<li>Reference 3 - 0.27% Coverage =&gt; Sometimes configuration options are designed without taking full account of the consequences
</li>

<li>Reference 4 - 0.37% Coverage =&gt; the most common problem is that the developer who wrote the application is usually the only one or the most familiar with the options.

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Reference 1 - 0.21% Coverage =&gt; standard way of separating runtime vs non-runtime changeable properties
</li>

<li>Reference 2 - 0.35% Coverage =&gt; I tend to leave too many configuration options hard coded into the application, making it difficult to change from a client side
</li>

<li>Reference 3 - 0.23% Coverage =&gt; Software by design is open and flexible, configurations are static by their nature.
</li>

<li>Reference 4 - 0.17% Coverage =&gt; making it clear what type of user benefits from a given setting
</li>

<li>Reference 5 - 1.22% Coverage =&gt; The most important problem is knowing what options our users want and how to tailor those options to that audience. Often times​ we can’t communicate with all of our users and that creates a very big gap of understanding between developers and our userbase. We have to guess what our users want and the issue with that is that we have an audience that is comprised of very different people who have different needs and who have very different goals.
</li>

<li>Reference 6 - 1.02% Coverage =&gt; This is even more complicated in the case of our project because we have to even consider people who aren’t directly using or developing for our platform because Glowkit is a fork of an actively used project. We can’t really solve this issue but we can lessen its effects by determining use cases and finding configuration options that could be created to help that use case.

Which should trump the other? The answer is not obvious and requires thought.

<li>Reference 1 - 0.19% Coverage =&gt; Errors derived from skipping/ignoring conf options during testing
</li>

<li>Reference 2 - 0.07% Coverage =&gt; Just test properly the app
</li>

<li>Reference 3 - 0.12% Coverage =&gt; Automated testing is extremely important
</li>

<li>Reference 4 - 0.51% Coverage =&gt; I developed an ANTLR based grammar based on the LDAP Filter specification and generated the JAVA code based on it. Then we created excessive Unit tests to verify that it works correctly.
</li>

<li>Reference 5 - 0.44% Coverage =&gt; To overcome it, automated reviews and tests should be incorporated into the coding flow so anyone who adds or changes configuration will be aware of the outcome.
</li>

<li>Reference 6 - 0.31% Coverage =&gt; Less so for testing them. We generally mark less covered areas or new features configurations as experimental.
</li>

<li>Reference 7 - 0.11% Coverage =&gt; some options are not tested well enough
</li>

<li>Reference 8 - 0.26% Coverage =&gt; all configuration scenarios must be tested, no tests = bugs which are subtle &amp;amp; difficult to fix
</li>

<li>Reference 9 - 0.17% Coverage =&gt; Adding new options in a hurry without carefully checking them
</li>

<li>Reference 10 - 0.13% Coverage =&gt; Testing all the various configuration options
</li>

<li>Reference 11 - 0.11% Coverage =&gt; Unit testing is alwas quiet difficult
</li>

<li>Reference 12 - 0.87% Coverage =&gt; The existence of options implies an additional testing burden, and even when it is possible in principle to test a given option (it does not require any special operating system, for example), often it is not tested, or not all combinations of interacting options are tested.configuration of several environments

<li>Reference 2 - 0.36% Coverage =&gt; Being able to validate all configuration options upfront (at boot); valide them individually and in combination. Report typos.
